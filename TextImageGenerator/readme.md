I used the TextRecognitionDataGenerator tool to generate text images. The dictionary present in ./dicts/out_dict.txt has beem used to generate the text images. This dictionary of names of places (streets, cities, etc.) in India has been curated by filtering out only the Indian data from GeoNames database (http://www.geonames.org/). 

The data that I generated by runnning the following command can be downloaded from https://goo.gl/SkdBmr

python run.py -i <Path to input dictionary of text> -c <Count or number of images to be generated> -k <Skew angle> -k -bl <Gaussian Blurring> -rbl
