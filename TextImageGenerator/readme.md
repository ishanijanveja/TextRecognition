I used the [TextRecognitionDataGenerator](https://textrecognitiondatagenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) tool to generate text images. The dictionary present in [TextImageGenerator/dicts/out_dict.txt](https://github.com/ishanijanveja/TextRecognition/blob/master/TextImageGenerator/dicts/out_dict.txt) has beem used to generate the text images. This dictionary of names of places (streets, cities, etc.) in India has been curated by filtering out only the Indian data from GeoNames database (http://www.geonames.org/). 

The data that I generated by runnning the following command can be downloaded from my [drive](https://goo.gl/SkdBmr)

`python run.py -i <Path to input dictionary of text> -c <Count or number of images to be generated> -k <Skew angle> -k -bl <Gaussian Blurring> -rbl`

More details about the usage of this data genertion tool may be found at this [link](https://textrecognitiondatagenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
