To develop a premise for the task that this repository intends to preform, read [TextRecognition-CRNN.pdf](https://github.com/ishanijanveja/TextRecognition/blob/master/TextRecognition-CRNN.pdf)

This repository consists of two directories - **TextImageGenerator** and **CRNN**. The TextImageGenerator is 
used to generate text images from a dictionary that you may provide. On the other hand, CRNN contains the code-base for training and testing a CRNN model to recognise/transcribe the text in images. 

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ishanijanveja/TextRecognition/blob/master/requirements.txt).
Alternatively, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required dependencies.

To generate the data, follow steps mentioned in the readme present in TextImageGenerator.

To start training your own model OR for testing a trained model, follow steps mentioned in the readme present in CRNN
